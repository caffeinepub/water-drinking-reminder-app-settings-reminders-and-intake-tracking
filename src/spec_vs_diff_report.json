      "requirement": "Implement a public backend query method `isCallerAdmin() : async Bool` in `backend/main.mo` that returns whether the `caller` is an admin according to the existing access-control state (use `AccessControl.isAdmin(accessControlState, caller)`).",
      "reason": "No changes were made to `backend/main.mo` (or any backend source files). The only modified file is `project_state.json`, which does not add the canister method needed by the frontend.",
